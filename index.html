<p style="font-size:50px;"><b>Virginia Hunt</b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In working on this portfolio, I hope to showcase a breadth of skills that I have gained not only in my time in this class but in my time exploring the field of journalism as a whole. I hope that this portfolio will be a useful place for me to be creative in advertising the work that I have done, as well as the person I am.
<br> 
<br>
When thinking about what newsrooms I would like to target, I immediately think about WBEZ. I did a project that aimed to audit the business and engagement last fall in my Business of Journalism class, and it was a wonderful opportunity to learn about the history of the organization and some innovative things that they are doing, especially in the field of audio, which I love. I also would like to think about publications like Mother Jones and the Atlantic, as I think there is a lot of room to grow as it relates to graphics and interactives in these publications.
<br>
<br>
I plan to include a variety of interactives I have created on Flourish, specifcally about Chicago neighborhoods. I also may create interactives that could have been useful to past stories that I've written in order to show how much these tools can help a story. Additionally, I hope to spend time working on the aesthetics of my portfolio page.
