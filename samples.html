<p style="margin: 25px;">While I was a writing intern at Earthday.org, I had the opportunity to report on a variety of health and scientific stories. However, I think it would've been an amazing opportunity to make dense scientific information accessible to the general public using interactives. To show how I could have strengthened this story, I created a visualization that could have worked well in this story. 
  <br>
  <br>
  In this visualization, I used a simple statistic that was stated in my piece from a study done by Harvard. This research showed that women with the highest levels of phthalates, a microplastic, in their blood were 60 percent more likely to miscarry in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy than those with the lowest levels. However, I know that I can sometimes be confused about what “x more likely” means in respect to the percentages of people this applies to in a sample, so I decided to make this graphic in order to show that more clearly. 
  <br>
  <br>
  This interactive shows a sample of 100 women and uses the corresponding percentages to detail the risk levels within this hypothetical population, thus making the information more clear. Microplastics are integrated into a variety of products, including several targeted towards women — from menstrual products to makeup.
