<p style="margin-right: 200px; margin-left:200px">While I was a writing intern at Earthday.org, I had the opportunity to report on a variety of health and scientific stories. However, I think it would've been an amazing opportunity to make dense scientific information accessible to the general public using interactives. To show how I could have strengthened this story, I created a visualization that could have worked well in this story. 
  <br>
  <br>
  In this visualization, I used a simple statistic that was stated in my piece from a study done by Harvard. This research showed that women with the highest levels of phthalates, a microplastic, in their blood were 60 percent more likely to miscarry in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy than those with the lowest levels. However, I know that I can sometimes be confused about what “x more likely” means in respect to the percentages of people this applies to in a sample, so I decided to make this graphic in order to show that more clearly. 
  <br>
  <br>
  This interactive shows a sample of 100 women and uses the corresponding percentages to detail the risk levels within this hypothetical population, thus making the information more clear. Microplastics are integrated into a variety of products, including several targeted towards women — from <a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2022/en/d1en00755f">menstrual products</a> to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36365573/">makeup</a>. Thus, in working at Earthday.org, whose 2024 campaign centered around plastics, this story was important to engaging many younger women who may be affected personally by the impacts of plastics.

<p style="text-align: center;">What do I prioritize? Am I behind? These anxieties are common for many students during their first year of college. In this episode of Digital Diaries, Northwestern’s rising sophomores share the lessons they learned about these questions and more during their first year experiences, and how they’re using them now.
  <br>
  ELLA MARKS: There were some exams that maybe I felt as though I could’ve done a bit better and I was a little disappointed, but then I would take a step back and think about, “Well, I was able to go to this really cool event or spend some quality time with these people instead, and that’s more important to me on some levels than getting a slightly better grade.”

  VIRGINIA HUNT: From The Daily Northwestern, I’m Virginia Hunt. This is Digital Diaries, a weekly podcast following the college experience and asking students a question about life at Northwestern. In this episode, we’ll be talking to rising sophomores about the biggest lesson they learned from their freshman year, and how they’re using it now as students across all years plan for the year ahead. 
  <br>

  Think back to the night before move-in day. For many students, there’s a mix of nervous anticipation and excitement for the communities they will begin to form. For Weinberg sophomore Bela Filstrup, the importance of these communities resonated. 
  <br>
  BELA FILSTRUP: The biggest thing that my freshman year of college taught me is how much community around you matters.
  <br>
  VIRGINIA HUNT: Like many incoming students, Filstrup was anxious about leaving behind longstanding connections. 
  <br>
  BELA FILSTRUP: In high school, I was always really close with my family and I had been friends with my friends since forever, and so transitioning to college was a big adjustment and being away from all of that and rebuilding those communities. 
  <br>
  VIRGINIA HUNT: Though Northwestern hosts orientation events such as Wildcat Welcome and club fairs, Filstrup says that’s not the only way to connect. 
  <br>
  BELA FILSTRUP: Like even if it’s just a meal, you have to eat, and just having dinner with someone can do so much for improving your mental health, and allow you to focus on all the millions of other things that you have to focus on as a student. 
  <br>
  [SCRIBBLE SOUNDS]
  <br>
  VIRGINIA HUNT: Prioritizing having a community doesn’t look the same for everyone, and it may sometimes require a bit of sacrifice especially in a busy college environment. Weinberg sophomore Ella Marks’ lesson was learned from finding this balance.
  <br>
  ELLA MARKS: 
  One of the biggest lessons I’ve learned during my freshman year of college was what my priorities in college were and the effects of prioritizing them, and what it meant for me. 
  <br>
  VIRGINIA HUNT: Academic discipline is a hallmark characteristic of Northwestern students, who often keep busy schedules and hefty courseloads.
  <br>
  ELLA MARKS: I realized pretty early on that I could spend all of my time studying. I had enough work that I could spend my entire afternoon until 3 a.m. studying if I wanted, five to six days a week. 
  <br>
  VIRGINIA HUNT: For Marks, that wasn’t the best way to optimize her college experience. She wanted to find balance and have fun in a variety of ways. 
  <br>
  ELLA MARKS:Sometimes I would go hang out with friends at night, instead of taking an extra hour to study, and I realized that meant maybe I would do slightly worse on an exam, not horrible enough that it really negatively affected me, but I would have to understand those were some of the consequences of what my priorities in college are, and I learned to be okay with that.
  <br>
  [SCRIBBLE SOUNDS]
  <br>
  VIRGINIA HUNT: As students learn to figure out these priorities and develop themselves in this transition, rising McCormick sophomore Isaac Braunfeld hopes that they’ll give themselves grace.
  
  
  <br>
  ISAAC BRAUNFELD: Something that I think that I learned from my experience in freshman year is that you have to go at your own pace especially with the transition from high school to college. 
  <br>
  VIRGINIA HUNT: Braunfeld also warns against falling into the trap of comparison.
  <br>
  ISAAC BRAUNFELD: Some people adjust to it really quickly, and that’s really great for them, and some people take a lot longer, and some people don’t figure it out until sophomore or junior year even. Some people don’t figure it out until they graduate, and that’s okay because they figure it out eventually, 
  <br>
  VIRGINIA HUNT: The common thread running through all of these stories? A search for community.
  <br>
  ISAAC BRAUNFELD: It’s just important to be there for one another instead of holding yourself against one another. I think that that would be the piece of advice that I have to share. 
  <br>

<p style="margin-right: 200px; margin-left:200px">I was very interested in thinking about local libraries and what they mean for the community which they serve. I believe that looking at library circulation can be a helpful tool for understanding aspects of community welfare and involvement, especially as it relates to youth within a specific area.
<br>
<br>
When looking at this map, the two areas with the most circulation were the ZIP codes 60625, corresponding to the area around Albany Park and Lincoln Square, and 60605, corresponding to the neighborhoods near the South Loop.
<br>
<br>
The two areas with the lowest circulation (not counting one ZIP code which showed up with zero), are 60827, encompassing Riverdale and surrounding neighborhoods, and 60612, around the West Side and Ukrainian Village. 
<br>
<br>
60605 is one of the wealthiest ZIP codes in Chicago with a median household income of $107,811, while 60827 has one of the lowest median incomes at $31,008. While of course this is not a fully reported story and lacks data analysis to show further correlation, as well as reporting to understand why, if the trend does continue, why this trend is appearing, at first glance it seems like an interesting metric through which to understand how to better help communities which may have disparities in access to certain resources.

<p class="para" style="margin-right: 80px; margin-left:80px;">In my interactive journalism class, we learned how to aggregate data files and manipulate them using pivot tables and a variety of Excel functions in order to create visuals/interactives that make our journalism more accessible. For the map of Chicago which shows data clinics by location, I first gathered this data from the Chicago Data Portal and uploaded it to Google Sheets. I then made a pivot table which calculated the counts of clinics per ZIP code, and proceeded to upload this data to Flourish in the “Regions” section. I then went back to the Chicago Data Portal and downloaded the GeoJSON file, which I then uploaded to the “Regions Geometry” section. I then used the ZIP code columns to link the two pages, which yielded a gradient map of the data. To edit this, I went to the preview portion and to the layout to first limit the width of the interactive so that it would not take up the entire page. I then edited the regions layer section and chose to make the domain custom, so that portions which were unlisted would correspond to a white background, thus making it more clear that they had no data points.
<br>
<br>
This process is relatively similar to the one used to make the graphic with points on the map, except that in that map all manipulation of the data was done within the Flourish platform. I uploaded the data to both the “Regions” section and the “Points” section. <br>
<br>
I proceeded to select the latitude and longitude listed within the data set on the “Points” section, and within the “Region” section selected the site name for the name. I once again edited the layout in the preview screen to make the image less wide, and also listed the popup information as custom. I then put the header as “Site Name” and the main content as {{your column name here}} for what I had put the site name as, which for me was just “Site Name.”
<br>
<br>
For both of these, as for every interactive, it is important to include your sourcing and a headline, as well as information for a screenreader to allow it to be accessible to a variety of audiences. All of these can be done on Flourish in their respective sections
