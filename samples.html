<p style="margin: 25px;">While I was a writing intern at Earthday.org, I had the opportunity to report on a variety of health and scientific stories. However, I think it would've been an amazing opportunity to make dense scientific information accessible to the general public using interactives. To show how I could have strengthened this story, I created a visualization that could have worked well in this story. 
  <br>
  <br>
  In this visualization, I used a simple statistic that was stated in my piece from a study done by Harvard. This research showed that women with the highest levels of phthalates, a microplastic, in their blood were 60 percent more likely to miscarry in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy than those with the lowest levels. However, I know that I can sometimes be confused about what “x more likely” means in respect to the percentages of people this applies to in a sample, so I decided to make this graphic in order to show that more clearly. 
  <br>
  <br>
  This interactive shows a sample of 100 women and uses the corresponding percentages to detail the risk levels within this hypothetical population, thus making the information more clear. Microplastics are integrated into a variety of products, including several targeted towards women — from <a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2022/en/d1en00755f">menstrual products</a> to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36365573/">makeup</a>. Thus, in working at Earthday.org, whose 2024 campaign centered around plastics, this story was important to engaging many younger women who may be affected personally by the impacts of plastics.

  <p style="margin: 25px;"> <b> How I processed this data</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Gathered the data from the paper/statistic</li>
    <li>Did math to find out what this would yield out of a population of 100</li>
    <li>Uploaded this simple 2x2 chart to Flourish</li>
    <li>Selected a visual where it would show graphics of people color-coded for the data</li>
    <li>Changed the colors to make it accessible (no red/green for colorblindness, etc.)</li>
    <li>Added screenreader text, title and sourcing</li>
  </ul>

<p style="margin: 25px">I was very interested in thinking about local libraries and what they mean for the community which they serve. I believe that looking at library circulation can be a helpful tool for understanding aspects of community welfare and involvement, especially as it relates to youth within a specific area.
<br>
<br>
When looking at this map, the two areas with the most circulation were the ZIP codes 60625, corresponding to the area around Albany Park and Lincoln Square, and 60605, corresponding to the neighborhoods near the South Loop.
<br>
<br>
The two areas with the lowest circulation (not counting one ZIP code which showed up with zero), are 60827, encompassing Riverdale and surrounding neighborhoods, and 60612, around the West Side and Ukrainian Village. 
<br>
<br>
60605 is one of the wealthiest ZIP codes in Chicago with a median household income of $107,811, while 60827 has one of the lowest median incomes at $31,008. While of course this is not a fully reported story and lacks data analysis to show further correlation, as well as reporting to understand why, if the trend does continue, why this trend is appearing, at first glance it seems like an interesting metric through which to understand how to better help communities which may have disparities in access to certain resources.

<p class="para">In my interactive journalism class, we learned how to aggregate data files and manipulate them using pivot tables and a variety of Excel functions in order to create visuals/interactives that make our journalism more accessible. For the map of Chicago which shows data clinics by location, I first gathered this data from the Chicago Data Portal and uploaded it to Google Sheets. I then made a pivot table which calculated the counts of clinics per ZIP code, and proceeded to upload this data to Flourish in the “Regions” section. I then went back to the Chicago Data Portal and downloaded the GeoJSON file, which I then uploaded to the “Regions Geometry” section. I then used the ZIP code columns to link the two pages, which yielded a gradient map of the data. To edit this, I went to the preview portion and to the layout to first limit the width of the interactive so that it would not take up the entire page. I then edited the regions layer section and chose to make the domain custom, so that portions which were unlisted would correspond to a white background, thus making it more clear that they had no data points.
<br>
<br>
This process is relatively similar to the one used to make the graphic with points on the map, except that in that map all manipulation of the data was done within the Flourish platform. I uploaded the data to both the “Regions” section and the “Points” section. <br>
<br>
I proceeded to select the latitude and longitude listed within the data set on the “Points” section, and within the “Region” section selected the site name for the name. I once again edited the layout in the preview screen to make the image less wide, and also listed the popup information as custom. I then put the header as “Site Name” and the main content as {{your column name here}} for what I had put the site name as, which for me was just “Site Name.”
<br>
<br>
For both of these, as for every interactive, it is important to include your sourcing and a headline, as well as information for a screenreader to allow it to be accessible to a variety of audiences. All of these can be done on Flourish in their respective sections
