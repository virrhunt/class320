<p style="text-align: left; margin: 25;"> Since I was little, I loved to tell stories. Writing was such a special reprieve from a tumultuous home life, and eventually this grew into a love for helping other people tell their stories.

  My exploration into journalism began in high school when I started a podcast called "Because I Said So" about youth activism in the Nashville area. Now, I am at Northwestern's Medill School of Journalism with a dual major in journalism and biology, hoping to explore public health reporting and a variety of other topics that seek to create agency for those who have been silenced.
